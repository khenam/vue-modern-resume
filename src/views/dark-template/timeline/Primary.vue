            It was 2011 and I'd been addicted to a game called Street Mobsters. On its IR server, which is still available on <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111005204247/https://mobgangs.com/">mobgangs.com</a>, I decided to perform a phishing attack and harvest credentials of in-game wealthy people.

          <p>
            I hosted a page similar to this one and published it inside the game via various mediums. To be honest, I didn't expect any result but about 40 people had given me their username and passwords! among them, I selected wealthiest ones and ... you know rest of the story just add a Robin Hood at the end!

The website reached 9000 visits/day. More than 270+ musics with contents are published there.
          </p>

              The reason behind founding Bobet.ir was pretty simple: testing Google SEO patterns related to musics. But suddenly, it grew up so fast we decided to pivot and work on it as a real project.
